## Why This Mod is Now Open Source

This MelonLoader mod is being released as open source due to recent events in the community:

- **The compiled DLL was leaked** and has been circulating without authorization
- **Authentication systems were bypassed** by individuals redistributing cracked versions
- **Code has been copied extensively** by script kiddies without understanding or credit
- **Exploits and features were distributed freely** across various platforms
- **Endpoints were attacked and spammed** causing service disruptions
- **The Discord server was nuked** by malicious actors

Rather than continue fighting an uphill battle against piracy and unauthorized distribution, I've decided to embrace transparency and release the source code publicly.
